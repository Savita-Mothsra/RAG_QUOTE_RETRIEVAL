seasonAnd that's what it was all aboutAnd his teacher gave him an A\tand asked him to write more clearlyAnd his mother never hung it on the kitchen door\tbecause of its new paintAnd the kids told him\tthat Father Tracy smoked cigarsAnd left butts on the pewsAnd sometimes they would burn holesThat was the year his sister got glasses\twith thick lenses and black framesAnd the girl around the corner laughed\twhen he asked her to go see Santa ClausAnd the kids told him why\this mother and father kissed a lotAnd his father never tucked him in bed at nightAnd his father got mad\twhen he cried for him to do it.Once on a paper torn from his notebook\the wrote a poemAnd he called it \"Innocence: A Question\"\tbecause that was the question about his girlAnd that's what it was all aboutAnd his professor gave him an A\tand a strange steady lookAnd his mother never hung it on the kitchen door\tbecause he never showed herThat was the year that Father Tracy diedAnd he forgot how the end\tof the Apostle's Creed wentAnd he caught his sister\tmaking out on the back porchAnd his mother and father never kissed\tor even talkedAnd the girl around the corner\twore too much makeupThat made him cough when he kissed her\tbut he kissed her anyway\tbecause that was the thing to doAnd at three a.m. he tucked himself into bed\this father snoring soundlyThat's why on the back of a brown paper bag\the tried another poemAnd he called it \"Absolutely Nothing\"Because that's what it was really all aboutAnd he gave himself an A\tand a slash on each damned wristAnd he hung it on the bathroom door\tbecause this time he didn't think\the could reach the kitchen.\u201d - Stephen Chbosky, | poem"}, {"quote": "\u201cRespect other people's feelings.

I revere them when they live in tribes and families, in forests and groves. And even more I revere them when they stand alone. They are like lonely persons. Not like hermits who have stolen away out of some weakness, but like great, solitary men, like Beethoven and Nietzsche. In their highest boughs the world rustles, their roots rest in infinity; but they do not lose themselves there, they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only: to fulfil themselves according to their own laws, to build up their own form, to represent themselves. Nothing is holier, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree. When a tree is cut down and reveals its naked death-wound to the sun, one can read its whole history in the luminous, inscribed disk of its trunk: in the rings of its years, its scars, all the struggle, all the suffering, all the sickness, all the happiness and prosperity stand truly written, the narrow years and the luxurious years, the attacks withstood, the storms endured. And every young farmboy knows that the hardest and noblest wood has the narrowest rings, that high on the mountains and in continuing danger the most indestructible, the strongest, the ideal trees grow. Trees are sanctuaries. Whoever knows how to speak to them, whoever knows how to listen to them, can learn the truth. They do not preach learning and precepts, they preach, undeterred by particulars, the ancient law of life. A tree says: A kernel is hidden in me, a spark, a thought, I am life from eternal life. The attempt and the risk that the eternal mother took with me is unique, unique the form and veins of my skin, unique the smallest play of leaves in my branches and the smallest scar on my bark. I was made to form and reveal the eternal in my smallest special detail. A tree says: My strength is trust. I know nothing about my fathers, I know nothing about the thousand children that every year spring out of me. I live out the secret of my seed to the very end, and I care for nothing else. I trust that God is in me. I trust that my labor is holy. Out of this trust I live. When we are stricken and cannot bear our lives any longer, then a tree has something to say to us: Be still! Be still! Look at me! Life is not easy, life is not difficult. Those are childish thoughts. Let God speak within you, and your thoughts will grow silent. You are anxious because your path leads away from mother and home. But every step and every day lead you back again to the mother. Home is neither here nor there. Home is within you, or home is nowhere at all. A longing to wander tears my heart when I hear trees rustling in the wind at evening. If one listens to them silently for a long time, this longing reveals its kernel, its meaning. It is not so much a matter of escaping from one's suffering, though it may seem to be so. It is a longing for home, for a memory of the mother, for new metaphors for life. It leads home. Every path leads homeward, every step is birth, every step is death, every grave is mother. So the tree rustles in the evening, when we stand uneasy before our own childish thoughts: Trees have long thoughts, long-breathing and restful, just as they have longer lives than ours. They are wiser than we are, as long as we do not listen to them. But when we have learned how to listen to trees, then the brevity and the quickness and the childlike hastiness of our thoughts achieve an incomparable joy.

I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago. Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you. Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant. You alone have brought me to Bath. For you alone, I think and plan. Have you not seen this? Can you fail to have understood my wishes? I had not waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have penetrated mine. I can hardly write. I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me. You sink your voice, but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others. Too good, too excellent creature! You do us justice, indeed. You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men. Believe it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither, or follow your party, as soon as possible. A word, a look, will be enough to decide whether I enter your father's house this evening or never.\u201d - Jane Austen, | romance"}, {"quote": "\u201cSomeone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness.
